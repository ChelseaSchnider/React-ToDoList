# React-ToDoList
ToDoList app made with create-react-app
Wrote the code as I found on codepen. It was one page so I made a components folder which I then imported the respective components into App.js
I tried this code a few months ago and couldn't get it right for a project I had to do while doing my course
Attempted it again and it worked. Modified what I wanted to make it "more" mine. 

If you want to use the code, here is the link to codepen https://codepen.io/dylangggg/pen/xoEPYR
